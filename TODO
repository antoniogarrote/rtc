The following are major tasks for Rtc, marked with trivial, hard, or simply tedious:
- Polymorphic functions (hard)
- Class annotations (trivial)
- Field support/syntatic sugar (trivial)
- Options (error on type mismatch, or log) (trivial)
- Tuple types (trivial)
- Symbol support in the grammar (trivial)
- block annotations (hard)
- grammar cleanup (tedious)
- standard library annotations (very tedious)
- Recursive type checks (type checking code requires arrays, manipulation of which requires type checked code...)
- supposrt for intersection types in annotations
